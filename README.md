# OOS_praktikum-1

This is code for praktikum-1 of OOS, where I am creating two base classes inside a package called bank.
Both the classes have 3 constructors:-
1. A constructor with only minimal arguments 
2. A constructor with all the arguments
3. A copy constructor

the class Main serves as the entry point of the entire code.
class Main is mostly being used to test the functionality of the base classes Payment and Transfer.
